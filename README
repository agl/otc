OpenType Condom
---------------

(Idea and name from Alex Russell)

The CSS font-face property[1] is great for web typography. Having to use images
in order to get the correct typeface is a great sadness; one should be able to
use vectors.

However, the TrueType renderers on many platforms have never been part of the
attack surface before and putting them on the front line is a scary proposition.
Esp on platforms like Windows where it's a closed-source blob running with high
privilege.

Thus, the OpenType Condom (OTC) is designed to parse and serialise OpenType
files, validating them and sanitising them as it goes. Most significantly, it
removes hinting bytes from the files as it processes.

This is just an initial release. Do not use it in anger yet.
